Card Game "21"

This repository contains the code and documentation for a card game called "21," which was designed and developed in C++11 from March to April 2023. The game simulates the popular card game "21," played on the terminal also known as "Blackjack."

Features
Random card draws: The game includes a mechanism to randomly draw cards from a deck, simulating the element of chance in the game.
Dependent cards: Certain cards have dependencies on each other, affecting the gameplay and strategy.
High-definition mode: Implemented a high-definition mode for enhanced visual experience during gameplay.
Player classes: Two player classes were created - one for youth players and another for adult players. These classes encapsulate the behavior and attributes specific to each player type.
Object-oriented programming: Utilized object-oriented programming concepts to create a base class that encompasses common functions and data, with derived classes for specific player types. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.
Code reviews: Conducted code reviews to ensure consistency and high quality of the codebase.
Debugging and issue resolution: Detected and resolved issues in the code to ensure the application functions properly and is free of errors.
Agile methodologies: Utilized agile methodologies to plan and prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring the timely completion of the project.
Installation and Usage
